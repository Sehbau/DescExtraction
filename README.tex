Here we run the program 'dscx'. It creates the descriptor output for an image. Three
executables are available:

dscx.exe    compiled under Windows 10                       [64 bit, x64]
dscx_ubu    compiled under Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS (Focal Fossa) [64 bit, x64]
dscx_deb    compiled under Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   [64 bit, ARM]

For documentation see descExtr.pdf. In the following, only an overview is given.

The program takes the image formats jpg and png. It writes various types of features
to files.

Directories: 

- Imgs	 contains example images for immediate probing
- Desc   demonstrates what the output files look like (as generated by dscx) 
- UtilMb contains Matlab scripts to load some of the output files

Program 'dscx' takes two file names as input (arguments):
   1) an image path
   2) an output file path. This path needs to include an existing directory name.

For example: with images in 'Imgs', and the output directory 'Desc', run image 'img1'
as follows:

   dscx Imgs\img1.jpg Desc\img1	   (windows)
   dscx Imgs/img1.jpg Desc/img1	   (linux)

The output file path must contain a valid path ('Desc/' in this case), as the
program checks for slashes, otherwise it aborts. The program will write the
following files into directory 'Desc':

    - img1.Bbox	    bounding boxes of regions
    - img1.CntEpt   contour endpoints of ridge, river and edge segments 
    - img1.vec	    descriptor vectors (attributes)
    - img1.hst	    descriptor histograms

You can load the first two files into Matlab as demonstrated in directory UtilMb,
see script exampleLoad.m for explanations.
